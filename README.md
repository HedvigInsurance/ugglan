## Provision new devices

## Formatting

We use swift-format for formatting, it's ran on all staged files automatically in a pre-commit hook.

1. Install githooks
   
   sh `scripts/githooks.sh`
   
2. In a separate directory from ugglan
   
   sh `git clone -b swift-5.4-branch https://github.com/apple/swift-format.git`
   
   
3.  navigate to the Scripts folder then sh `swift build -c release --disable-sandbox`
4. sh `find . -type f -name swift-format`
5. Find the corresponding build, should be something like `./.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/swift-format`
6. sh `cp .build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/swift-format /usr/local/bin/swift-format`
7. Done!
