## Known issues

### Run post-checkout issue
This issue is related to the Xcode caching

`xcodebuild: error: Could not resolve package dependencies: failed downloading 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/HedvigInsurance/authlib/com/hedvig/authlib/authlib-kmmbridge/1.3.21-alpha-20240313135116/authlib-kmmbridge-1.3.21-alpha-20240313135116.zip' which is required by binary target 'authlib': badResponseStatusCode(401)`
###### Running this commands in the terminal should resolve it:
`rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm`

`rm -rf ~/Library/org.swift.swiftpm`

and deleting everything inside

/Users/youruser/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
