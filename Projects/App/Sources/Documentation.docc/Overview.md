# Overview

Ugglan is the codebase for Hedvigâ€™s iOS app. Ugglan uses a micro features architecture, which means that each feature of the app is implemented as an independent module that can be tested independentely. This improves scalability, performance, and code quality.

### Tuist

Ugglan uses Tuist, a tool that helps generate, maintain and interact with Xcode projects programmatically. Tuist simplifies the configuration and setup of Xcode projects by using Swift configuration files.

### Features

- A feature is a module that encapsulates a specific functionality of the app, such as authentication, chat, or claims.
- A feature has its own folder structure, resources, and tests.
- A feature should only depend on hCore & hCoreUI, not each other.
- A feature can be added or removed from the app by modifying the `Project.swift` file.

### Ugglan Base Project

- The project is the user-facing application that coordinates all the features and ties everything together.
- The project is generated by Tuist using the Project.swift file in the root directory of the repo.
- The project defines the app target, settings, schemes, dependencies, and launch arguments.
- This is the app that gets published on app stores.
